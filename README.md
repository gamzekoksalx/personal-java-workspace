# Personal Java Workspace

This repository is a personal workspace created by Gamze Köksal for experimenting with Java and its related technologies, libraries, and tools. It contains hands-on practice projects organized by topic in separate branches. The goal is to deepen understanding of core Java concepts, UI frameworks, data structures, and other utilities through practical coding.

## Structure

Each branch is dedicated to a specific topic or tool:

- `swing` – Practice and demos using Java Swing for building desktop applications.
- `fx` – JavaFX experiments and UI component exercises.
- `map` – Projects exploring the Java Map interface and related data structures.
- `threading` – Multithreading, concurrency tools, and performance testing.
- `streams` – Java Streams API examples and transformations.
- `regex` – Regular expression practice and utilities in Java.
- `json` – Working with JSON in Java (Jackson, Gson, etc.).

> New branches and topics will be added over time as I continue learning and exploring.

## Why This Repo?

Java is a vast ecosystem, and this repository helps organize and document my journey through its many components. It’s a growing reference point for future projects and a place to try things freely.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse individual branches to view topic-specific exercises. Each branch will contain a `README.md` for brief explanations of what’s being practiced.
